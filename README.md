# Harvester Dashboard

[![Build Status](http://drone-publish.rancher.io/api/badges/harvester/dashboard/status.svg)](http://drone-publish.rancher.io/harvester/dashboard)

Harvester Dashboard UI, Harvester is an open-source hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) software built on Kubernetes.

## Running for Development

This is what you probably want to get started.

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# For development, serve with hot reload at https://localhost:8005
# using the endpoint for your Harvester API
API=https://your-harvester yarn dev
# or put the variable into a .env file
# Goto https://localhost:8005
```

```
# build harvester plugin
yarn build-pkg harvester && yarn serve-pkgs

# Open another terminal
HARVESTER_PKG_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4500/harvester-${version}/harvester-${version}.umd.min.js API=https://your-harvester yarn mem-dev
```

## Other Building Modes

```bash
# Build for standalone use within Harvester
# (These are done on commit/tag via Drone)
./scripts/build-embedded # for embedding into harvester builds
./scripts/build-hosted # for hosting on a static file webserver and pointing Harvester's ui-index at it
# Output in dist/

# Develop via Docker instead of a local nodejs
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t dashboard:dev .
docker run -v $(pwd):/src \
  -v dashboard_node:/src/node_modules \
  -p 8005:8005 \
  -e API=https://your-rancher \
  dashboard:dev
# The first time will take *forever* installing node_modules into the volume; it will be faster next time.
# Goto https://localhost:8005

# Developing against a standalone "Steve" API on a Mac
git clone https://github.com/rancher/steve.git
cd steve
make run-host

cd dashboard
docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t rancher/dashboard:dev .
docker run -v $(pwd):/src \
  -v dashboard_node:/src/node_modules \
  -p 8005:8005 \
  -e API=http://172.17.0.1:8989 \
  rancher/dashboard:dev
# The first time will take *forever* installing node_modules into the volume; it will be faster next time.
# Goto https://localhost:8005
```

# What is it?

Dashboard is "stateless" client for the Harvester APIs built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/).  It is normally built and packaged as a folder of static HTML/CSS/JS files which are bundled into a Harvester release, with the index.html returned by the API server as the "fallback" case for any request that looks like it came from a browser and does not match an API URL.
